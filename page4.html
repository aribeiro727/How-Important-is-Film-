    <h1>What does film mean to people? What role does it play in our lives?</h1>
       <p>For me, movies have always played a pivitol role in my life. For the longest time I wanted to be a filmmaker. I made countless films with friends and family when I was a kid. For me, movies were a way for me to expereince incredible stories that could not be told through books, graphic novels, etc.. I always had a hard time when it came to reading. Movies were a way for me to expereince these adventures, told through a cinematic lense. Over the years I have watched countless films. Some good and some bad. No matter the quality, I always get something out of these experiences. </p>

        <p>The wide world of film is massive and anyone is welcome to create. To put boundaries on film is criminal and there are ways in which I think film and the art that goes with it is dying. Movies and cinema are much more common place and produced these days and therefore, it was capitalized on. Disney used to be a company I loved. Their animated movies from years passed were incredible examples of what unlimted imagination can bring to the big screen. Disney now suffers the fate of capitalizing off of their success. The movies they produce are souless cash grabs and nothing more. There is no room for creativity or imagination within Walt Disney Studios. That being said, there are shining examples of great modern cinema. All of the movies I have listed so far are great examples of what artistic, imaginative cinema can look like.</p>
